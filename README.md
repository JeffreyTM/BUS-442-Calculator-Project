# BUS-442-Calculator-Project

NC State University 
BUS 442 Major Project 2: Pair Coding Competition

Code Authors: Jeffrey Michaels and Will Shomo


This application has two types of calculators built in: a statistical 
    calculator and a scientific calculator. The statistical calculator reads 
    in a file of data points and has buttons that displays various evaluations 
    on the data points, such as the mean, median, mode, range, etc. The scientific 
    calculator reads input for x and y (if y is needed) that is either typed in 
    directly by the user, or inputted by pushing the keypad buttons, and evaluates 
    various scientific calculations such as the factorial, fibonacci sequence, x^y, etc.


All coding was done in Visual Studio in .NET Framework v4.7.2
